# Testing the Measurement Tools

## Fixed Issues:

### 1. **Coordinate Mapping Fixed**
- Simplified coordinate transformation to use container coordinates directly
- Both the image and measurement overlay are inside the same `Transform.scale`
- Measurements now appear exactly where you click

### 2. **Mac Trackpad Scroll Fixed**
- Added support for both vertical and horizontal scroll events
- Increased scroll threshold to prevent accidental slice changes
- Now properly handles Mac trackpad gestures

### 3. **Gesture Conflict Resolution**
- Measurement tool selection now disables pan/zoom gestures
- When a measurement tool is selected, only taps are processed for measurements
- When no tool is selected, normal image interaction (pan/zoom) works

## How to Test:

### Distance Measurement:
1. **Load a DICOM image** (file or directory)
2. **Click the Distance tool** (ruler icon) in the toolbar
3. **Click two points** on the image - measurement appears instantly
4. **Deselect tool** by clicking the Distance button again

### Angle Measurement:
1. **Click the Angle tool** (architecture icon)
2. **Click vertex point first** (center of the angle)
3. **Click first arm point**
4. **Click second arm point** - angle measurement appears

### Circle Measurement:
1. **Click the Circle tool** (circle icon)
2. **Click center point**
3. **Click edge point** - circle with radius/area appears

### Scroll Navigation:
- **Mouse wheel**: Scroll up/down to change slices
- **Mac trackpad**: Two-finger scroll (vertical or horizontal) to change slices
- **Navigation buttons**: Use arrow buttons below the image

### Measurement Management:
- **👁️ Toggle visibility**: Show/hide all measurements
- **🗑️ Clear all**: Remove all measurements
- **Long press measurement**: View details and delete option

## Expected Behavior:
✅ Measurements appear exactly where you click
✅ Trackpad scroll works for slice navigation
✅ Multiple measurements can be created
✅ Measurements persist when changing slices
✅ Real-world units when pixel spacing available
✅ Preview lines show while creating measurements
